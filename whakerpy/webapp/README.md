# WebApp package

## Scope

The `webapp` package implements the **application layer** of WhakerPy.

It is responsible for:

- loading and validating web application configuration
- launching a local HTTP server
- connecting applications to the HTTPD engine
- providing a clean interface between **applications** and **HTTP transport**

This package **does not** implement HTTP mechanics or security logic.
Those belong to `httpd`.


## Design principles

### 1. Clear separation from HTTPD

| Concern | Package |
|------|---------|
| HTTP protocol, handlers, policies | `httpd` |
| Application configuration and launch | `webapp` |
| HTML tree and serialization | `htmlmaker` |
| UI / HTML response recipe | `WebSiteResponse` (subclass of `httpd.BaseResponseRecipe`) |

`webapp` glues **applications** to the **HTTP engine**.


### 2. One application = one configuration

Each web application is described by:

- a JSON configuration file
- parsed once into a `WebSiteData` object

That object becomes the **single source of truth** for:

- page tree
- static paths
- blacklist rules
- signed URL rules

No duplicated parsing.


### 3. Same application, two execution modes

The same application can run:
- locally with its built-in HTTP server;
- in production or locally with uWSGI / WSGI service.

`webapp` ensures:

- identical configuration
- identical policy behavior
- no application-side branching


## Main modules and roles

### WebSiteData

Role:

- configuration loader and validator

Main class:

- `WebSiteData`

Responsibilities:

- parse JSON configuration
- expose structured attributes (pages, static paths, blacklist, signed_url)
- create the dynamic page tree

It does **not**:

- serve HTTP
- apply policies
- generate responses

It is a **data container**, not a controller.

### WebSiteApplication

Role:

- local application launcher

Main class:

- `WebSiteApplication`

Responsibilities:

- instantiate the HTTP server (`BaseHTTPDServer`)
- pass configuration to the server
- start / stop the local server
- compute client URL

This is the **only place** where:

- server lifecycle is managed
- configuration is injected into the server

It does **not**:

- handle requests
- implement policies
- generate HTML


### WebSiteResponse

Role:

- base interface between applications and the server

Responsibilities:

- define how an application exposes pages
- map page names to response builders
- provide default behaviors

This module defines the **contract** an application must satisfy
to be served by WhakerPy.

It does **not**:

- know routing rules
- know security policies
- access configuration directly


### WSGIApplication

Role:

- WSGI entry point for production deployment

Main class:

- `WSGIApplication`

Responsibilities:

- adapt WhakerPy to the WSGI interface
- register pages (`add_page`)
- forward requests to the same HTTPD logic
- apply the same policies as the local server

Guarantees:

- identical behavior local / production
- no duplicated logic
- a `GET` request carries its parameters the same way a `POST` does, and an
  unhandled `GET` event (status `205`) still serves the page with a `200`,
  exactly like the local `HTTPDHandler`


## Extensibility

This package is the right place to add:

- new application launchers
- alternative configuration sources
- new application descriptors

Without touching:

- HTTP handlers
- security policies
- application code


## Summary

- `webapp` is the **application orchestration layer**
- it loads configuration once
- it launches applications consistently
- it bridges applications and HTTPD cleanly
- it keeps application code independent of transport details

This package defines **how an application becomes a website**.
